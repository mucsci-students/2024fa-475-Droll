----------How to play----------
Get 2 people,
one player controls left half of keyboard
other controls right

Your goal is to reduce the other players health to 0
Each player has access to offensive and defensive units
Defesives units are the BARRIOR and SHOOTER, these units take up a grid slot and 2 cannot occupy the same spot
	*shooters fire bullets which can be thought of as offensive units
Offensive units are the WALKER and RUNNER, these units advance towards the enemy attacking enemy units and base if reached

Units, when destroyed, give half of their cost to the opposing side, even if destroy by netrual units

//NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
Netrual Units spawn periodically
These units go after both sides,
Occassionally, a boss unit will spawn
	while this unit has a lot of health, which ever side kills it gets a large amount of money
